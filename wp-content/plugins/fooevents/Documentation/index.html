<h3>Ticket types and variations</h3>
You can create various ticket types using WooCommerce's attributes and variations functionality. To do this please follow these instructions:
<ol>
  <li>Go to the ‘Attributes’ tab in the Product Data panel</li>
  <li>Create a new attribute called ‘Ticket Type’. It’s very important that the attribute is called this as this is the name that is used to reflect the ticket type on the actual ticket</li>
  <li>Add the name of each ticket type under values and separate them with the pipe symbol ‘|’ e.g. VIP | General | Early Bird</li>
  <li>Make sure that you select ‘Visible on the product page’ and ‘Used for variations’</li>
  <li>Save the attributes</li>
  <li>Click on the ‘Attributes’ tab in the Product Data panel</li>
  <li>Add a variation for each ticket type and specify the relevant ticket criteria (price, in stock etc.)</li>
  <li>Make sure that you select ‘Enabled’</li>
  <li>We recommend that you select ‘Virtual’ if you do not want the shipping information to be displayed on the checkout screen</li>
  <li>Save/update the post once all variations have been added</li>
  <li>The ticket type variations will now display as ticket options when purchasing a ticket</li>
</ol>
Once your product is published it will appear in your WooCommerce store and users will be able to purchase tickets for your event

            <h2 id="barcodes">Barcodes</h2>
            
<h3>What is a barcode?</h3>
A barcode is a machine-readable code in the form of numbers and a pattern of parallel lines of varying widths, printed on a commodity and used especially for stock control.
<h3>How does FooEvents use barcodes?</h3>
Every ticket that is generated contains a unique barcode that is rendered using the barcode code 128 standard. If you own a scanner that can read ordinary 1D barcodes then you have the option of scanning tickets to find them quickly. We created the <a href="https://www.fooevents.com/fooevents-express-check-in/">FooEvents Attendee Check-ins plugin</a> to provide a better experience when using a 1D barcode scanner. The 'FooEvents Check-ins' <a href="https://www.fooevents.com/apps/">apps</a> can also be used to check-in people at events on your tablet or smartphone device.

            <h2 id="using-the-event-check-ins-pro-auto-check-in">Using the Event Check-ins Pro Auto check-in</h2>
            
If you’ve purchased the unbranded pro version of the FooEvents Check-ins app, you can make use of the auto check-in functionality by enabling it in the app’s settings panel. Auto check-in significantly speeds up the check-in process by checking in attendees automatically when their ticket is scanned instead of first opening the ticket and requiring you to tap on the ‘Confirm’ button to check in that attendee. If the ticket is unpaid, canceled or already checked in, you will be notified as you scan the ticket. You can still tap to open the ticket if you need to see its details.<i> </i>

If you’ve purchased the unbranded pro version of the FooEvents Check-ins app, you can customize the look of it to suit your brand. By changing the settings of your FooEvents for WooCommerce plugin, you are able to specify various colors and provide a URL to a logo that should display in the app.

You can upload your logo in the WordPress Media library and then insert the generated URL to the image file in the settings panel input for your logo. A PNG image with transparency and a width of around 940px is recommended.

You are able to change the colors of the following:
<ul>
  <li>the top navigation bar and sign-in button</li>
  <li>the text that appears in the top navigation bar and sign-in button</li>
  <li>the sign-in screen’s background</li>
  <li>the text that appears on the sign-in screen</li>
</ul>
When opening the pro app for the first time, it will display the default coloring and logo, but once you sign-in successfully, the interface will update with all the specified color values and uploaded logo. These values are stored on the device and will show instead of the default coloring and logo each time you open the app. The values are updated upon each successful sign-in, so if you need to make a change to any of the colors or the logo, you can just save the new settings in the FooEvents for WooCommerce plugin, sign out of the app and sign back in to get the updated values stored on the device.

            <h2 id="how-fooevents-stores-data">How FooEvents stores data</h2>
            
            <h3>Database</h3>
            FooEvents stores basic plugin configurations within the WordPress database using standard WordPress methods. All settings and configurations are stored within the wp_options table. 
            FooEvents extends WooCommerce product functionality to create event products. This is done by adding certain meta to products using standard WordPress and WooCommerce methods. All event meta is stored within the wp_postmeta table where the post_id matches the product ID.
            <br /><br />
            On checkout, attendee, ticket and customer data is stored as meta within the WooCommerce order custom post type in the wp_postmeta table. This data is stored where the meta_key = "WooCommerceEventsOrderTickets" and where the post_id matches the custom post type order ID.
            <br /><br />
            FooEvents uses a custom post type to create event tickets. This custom post type is named "event_magic_tickets" and is stored in the wp_posts table. Meta is added to the ticket custom post type which contains ticket details and is stored within the wp_postmeta table where the post_id matches the "event_magic_ticket" ID.
            
            <h3>ICS files</h3>
            When the "Display 'Add to calendar' on ticket?" option is enabled in product event settings, this adds functionality that end users can download .ics files to add events to their calendars. This file is generated as soon as the end user clicks the "Add to calendar" button on their ticket and is not automatically updated remotely. The .ics files contain basic event information such as event name, date and time.
            
            <h3>CSV export files</h3>
            FooEvents contains functionality that allows the event organizer to export all event attendees and their details. This export feature is intended to be used as a backup in case the website administrator doesn't have access to attendee check-in functionality, as found in the <a href="https://www.fooevents.com/fooevents-express-check-in/">FooEvents Express Check-in</a> plugin and <a href="https://www.fooevents.com/apps/">FooEvents Check-ins app</a> for example. Information that is stored in this CSV export includes attendee and purchaser details, completed custom fields and selected variations and billing information (e.g. address, ticket check-in statuses). 
            <br/>
            <b>NB: The CSV export file is portable and printable and therefore appropriate care should be taken to keep this file safe by the site administrator and event staff.</b>
            
            <h3>Mobile Apps</h3>
            The <a href="https://www.fooevents.com/apps/">FooEvents Check-ins app</a> uses the built-in WordPress XML-RPC to communicate with FooEvents plugins in order to retrieve event and attendee data as well as process ticket check-ins. Data that is transferred between the plugins and app includes: Attendee and purchaser data, event data, ticket check-in status. 
            <br /><br />
            The app has offline features and therefore caches retrieved data on the device. The cached file is stored using standard iOS and Android development practices. 
            
            <h3>Barcodes</h3>
            FooEvents generates barcodes based on the unique ticket ID generated by the FooEvents plugin. Barcodes are used for ticket check-ins. The barcodes are stored in the 'wp-content/uploads/fooevents/barcodes' directory. The barcode filename is generated using the following formats: 
            <ul>
                <li>[unique-ticket-hash]-[unique-ticket-ID].jpg</li>
                <li>[unique-ticket-hash]-[unique-ticket-ID].png </li>
            </ul>
            Each ticket is assigned a unique ticket hash, ticket ID and ticket generation time. Barcodes are accessible via HTTP. 
            
            <h3>PDF Tickets</h3>
            When the FooEvents PDF Tickets plugin is active and enabled, PDF copies of tickets are generated and stored in the 'wp-content/uploads/fooevents/pdftickets' directory. 
            <br /><br />
            Single PDF tickets are named using the following format: 
            <ul>
                <li>[unique-ticket-hash]-[unique-ticket-ID].pdf</li>
            </ul>
            Multiple PDF tickets are named using the following format: 
            <ul>
                <li>[first-ticket-unique-ticket-hash]-[first-ticket-unique-ticket-ID]-[last-ticket-unique-ticket-hash]-[last-ticket-unique-ticket-ID].pdf</li>
            </ul>
            PDF tickets contain purchaser and attendee data, event data and end user selected variations. PDF tickets are accessible via HTTP. 
            
            <h3>Emails</h3>
            When the product event ticket option "Email tickets?" is enabled, the tickets are sent to either the attendee or purchaser depending on whether the "Email attendee rather than purchaser?" option is enabled or disabled. Tickets contain purchaser and attendee data, event data and end user selected variations. Once a ticket has been sent out, it will be stored indefinitely on the website administrators email server depending on the email address/es that were completed at checkout.

        <section>
            <h2 id="user-roles-capabilities-and-permissions">User roles, capabilities and permissions</h2>
            FooEvents makes extensive use of the built-in WordPress user role and capability functionality to ensure better privacy. By default, only users with the role of "Administrator" will have access to all the FooEvents features. If you require an additional role to have access to specific FooEvents features, you will need to assign capabilities to this role using a third-party WordPress plugin.
            <br /><br />
            Here are the steps required in order to do this:
            <ol>
                <li>Login to your WordPress Admin Area and install and activate the <b>User Role Editor</b> plugin: <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/user-role-editor/">https://wordpress.org/plugins/user-role-editor/</a> </li>
                <li>Navigate to 'Users' -> 'User Role Editor'</li>
                <li>Select the user role that needs access to specific FooEvents features under the "Select Role and change its capabilities" option</li>
                <li>Enter the term "event_magic_ticket" in the quick filter text box</li>
                <li>Check each of the items that have been highlighted (this is basically all the options with the "event_magic_ticket" and "event_magic_tickets" suffix)</li>
                <li>Click the "Update" button on the right</li>
            </ol>
